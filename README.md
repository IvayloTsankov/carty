# carty is python project for rc controlled car.
It is actually a firmware for raspberry pi car
which uses bluetooth for communication between remote controller and the car.


Future:
    Version 1.0:
        * light controller for controlling lights of the car.
        * move controller for controlling movement of the car.
        * extension manager for adding sensors.
        * different modes:
            a. real time mode - the car is controlled by remote controller in real time
            b. programmable mode - the user predifines set of instruction and send it to the car.
        * bluetooth communication - remote controller will communicate with the firmware through
                                    bluetooth module. It can be replaced with wifi communication.
